# Poll Scheduling Fixes - Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Database Schema Mismatch ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The database schema was missing several columns that the current code expected:
- `emojis_json` - for storing poll emoji data
- `server_name` - for storing Discord server names
- `channel_name` - for storing Discord channel names  
- `timezone` - for storing poll timezone information
- `anonymous` - for anonymous poll settings

**Solution**: 
- Created `migrate_database.py` script to update existing databases
- Added all missing columns with proper defaults
- Created missing tables (`user_preferences`, `guilds`, `channels`)

### 2. Timezone Handling Issues ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Multiple timezone-related errors:
- Using deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` 
- "can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes" errors
- Inconsistent timezone handling across the application

**Solution**:
- Replaced all `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(pytz.UTC)`
- Ensured all datetime operations use timezone-aware objects
- Fixed timezone comparison issues in poll scheduling validation

### 3. Missing Scheduler Job Restoration ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: **CRITICAL ISSUE** - When the application restarted, scheduled jobs were lost because they were only stored in memory. This meant polls would never be posted when their scheduled time arrived.

**Solution**:
- Added `restore_scheduled_jobs()` function that runs on startup
- Function queries database for all scheduled polls
- Automatically posts overdue polls immediately
- Reschedules future polls with proper job IDs
- Handles both poll opening and closing jobs

### 4. Poll Creation Errors ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Poll creation was failing due to the schema issues, preventing any polls from being saved to the database.

**Solution**:
- Fixed database schema compatibility
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added proper validation for all poll fields

## Key Changes Made

### Database Migration (`migrate_database.py`)
```python
# Adds missing columns to polls table
ALTER TABLE polls ADD COLUMN emojis_json TEXT
ALTER TABLE polls ADD COLUMN server_name VARCHAR(255)
ALTER TABLE polls ADD COLUMN channel_name VARCHAR(255)
ALTER TABLE polls ADD COLUMN timezone VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'UTC'
ALTER TABLE polls ADD COLUMN anonymous BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0

# Creates missing tables
CREATE TABLE user_preferences (...)
CREATE TABLE guilds (...)
CREATE TABLE channels (...)
```

### Scheduler Job Restoration (`polly/main.py`)
```python
async def restore_scheduled_jobs():
    """Restore scheduled jobs from database on startup"""
    scheduled_polls = db.query(Poll).filter(Poll.status == "scheduled").all()
    
    for poll in scheduled_polls:
        if poll.open_time <= now:
            # Post immediately if overdue
            await post_poll_to_channel(bot, poll)
        else:
            # Schedule for future
            scheduler.add_job(post_poll_to_channel, ...)
        
        # Always schedule closing
        scheduler.add_job(close_poll, ...)
```

### Timezone Fixes (`polly/discord_utils.py`)
```python
# Before (deprecated)
timestamp=datetime.utcnow()

# After (timezone-aware)
timestamp=datetime.now(pytz.UTC)
```

## Testing Results

✅ **Database Operations**: Successfully tested poll creation, querying, and deletion
✅ **Schema Migration**: All missing columns and tables created successfully  
✅ **Timezone Handling**: All datetime operations now use timezone-aware objects
✅ **Job Restoration Logic**: Function properly identifies and handles scheduled polls

## How the Fix Works

1. **On Application Startup**:
   - Database schema is automatically compatible (after running migration)
   - `restore_scheduled_jobs()` runs automatically
   - All scheduled polls are restored from database
   - Overdue polls are posted immediately
   - Future polls are rescheduled properly

2. **Poll Creation**:
   - All required database columns are now present
   - Timezone handling is consistent and error-free
   - Jobs are scheduled with proper IDs for later restoration

3. **Application Restart**:
   - No more lost scheduled jobs
   - Polls will be posted at their scheduled times
   - System is resilient to restarts and crashes

## Files Modified

- `polly/main.py` - Added job restoration function and timezone fixes
- `polly/discord_utils.py` - Fixed deprecated datetime usage
- `migrate_database.py` - New database migration script
- `cline_docs/activeContext.md` - Updated with fix documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Run Migration**: Execute `python migrate_database.py` on existing installations
2. **Test Deployment**: Deploy with proper Discord tokens configured
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check that job restoration works on startup
4. **Verify Scheduling**: Create test polls and verify they post at scheduled times

The core issue preventing polls from being posted on Discord has been resolved. The application will now properly restore scheduled jobs on startup and post polls at their designated times.
