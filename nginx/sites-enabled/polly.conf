# This is a symlink to ../sites-available/polly.conf
# In Docker, we'll create the actual symlink during container build
# For now, this file serves as a placeholder and reference

# To create the actual symlink in production:
# ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/polly.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/polly.conf

# Include the actual configuration
include /etc/nginx/sites-available/polly.conf;
